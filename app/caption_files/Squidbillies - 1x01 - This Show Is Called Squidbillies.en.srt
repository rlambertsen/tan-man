1
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:04,327
<i>This show is called Squidbillies.</i>

2
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:07,895
lt takes place in a quiet little town
nestled in the North Georgia mountains.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:14,476
lt has a gas station,
a dance studio, a Sheriff's office.

4
00:00:14,645 --> 00:00:17,978
Look! There's the Sheriff.

5
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:23,175
Three years from now
he'll die of emphysema.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,384
% He'll die of emphysema %

7
00:00:27,424 --> 00:00:30,916
% Three years from now %

8
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:34,522
That large building over there
is Dan Halen's Sheetrock.

9
00:00:34,565 --> 00:00:38,695
They specialize in sheetrock,
sheetrock mud, sheetrock screws...

10
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:41,705
pharmaceuticals, petroleum,
global mass media...

11
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:45,038
third world
covert military operations, and...

12
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:46,406
The baby hammock!

13
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:50,176
There's got to be a better way.

14
00:00:50,214 --> 00:00:51,306
There is!

15
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:53,339
Just connect the razor sharp hooks...

16
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:56,080
<i>to the dangerous
mesh cocoon, and presto!</i>

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,884
Another dead baby?
Sue the parents!

18
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:03,754
Take them for every dime.

19
00:01:03,794 --> 00:01:07,195
By calling the baby hammock
a baby deathtrap...

20
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:10,098
the parents had violated
Dan Halen's copyright

21
00:01:10,134 --> 00:01:14,070
on the term ''baby deathtrap,''
which he was already using for...

22
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:16,072
The baby deathtrap!

23
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:19,837
There's got to be a better way.

24
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:21,310
There is!

25
00:01:21,345 --> 00:01:24,405
Just place your baby
next to the magical electromonkey.

26
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:27,849
% Oh, go on,
they don't care about that %

27
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:29,147
% Let it go %

28
00:01:30,254 --> 00:01:31,278
All right.

29
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:33,882
So who else lives here?

30
00:01:33,924 --> 00:01:35,448
There's Space Baby.

31
00:01:36,493 --> 00:01:38,154
And Snakeman.

32
00:01:40,264 --> 00:01:43,995
Can't see who he's talking to.

33
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:46,002
lt doesn't really matter.

34
00:01:46,837 --> 00:01:50,329
That boy is Billy Morton,
star of the football team.

35
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:53,673
Your daddy whittled you
some fine limbs, son.

36
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:54,837
Watch this.

37
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,311
- They're talking playoffs this year.
- Well, l better get to practice, Sheriff.

38
00:02:03,354 --> 00:02:06,619
- Stay sweet, Billy.
- l will, Sher--

39
00:02:08,626 --> 00:02:11,060
Damn it! There goes the season.

40
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:15,697
This is the story of all the people
that live in this mountain town.

41
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:18,896
But mostly,
it's the story of Early Cuyler.

42
00:02:20,004 --> 00:02:22,268
Sweet, divine, delicious.

43
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:26,100
Excuse me.

44
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:29,670
You reckon you could give me permission
to date your pumpkin?

45
00:02:29,713 --> 00:02:32,204
- Get off my porch.
- Get out of your house!

46
00:02:32,249 --> 00:02:34,308
How do you like that?
You like that?

47
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:38,151
Early's real story begins 15 years ago.

48
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:41,487
% Early Cuyler was a young squid %

49
00:02:41,525 --> 00:02:46,053
% Young squid with his heart on fire %

50
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:47,825
Early, baby,
l'm gonna love you...

51
00:02:47,865 --> 00:02:51,323
till the mountains and the oceans,
like, collide with the sun...

52
00:02:51,368 --> 00:02:55,327
and like everything on the Earth's dead,
except for you and me and our love.

53
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:56,930
No!

54
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:59,704
You ain't gonna touch my front butt.

55
00:02:59,743 --> 00:03:04,271
Unless l get one of them
sport radio things with the ear buds.

56
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:06,613
And the autoreverse!

57
00:03:07,785 --> 00:03:12,449
l can't be joggin' and flippin' tapes
and drink my sip.

58
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:15,182
All right, then.

59
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,259
Lookit here! You give me all that money
you keepin' in that damn robot box.

60
00:03:19,296 --> 00:03:22,288
- Give it to me now! Do it! Do it!
- Here you go, take it.

61
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,302
Now, can l please have
one of them walkmans?

62
00:03:26,337 --> 00:03:29,795
- That'll be $34 if you got it.
- This oughta cover it.

63
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,705
Oh, that's...
Thanks, Early.

64
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:33,972
Ain't no Early here!
Give me all that money!

65
00:03:34,011 --> 00:03:35,945
Do it! Let's go!
Do it! Do it! Now! Now!

66
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,676
- Take it all. Just don't hurt me.
- Thank you, Boyd.

67
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:40,911
We'll see you in church.

68
00:03:40,951 --> 00:03:42,441
Bye, Early.

69
00:03:43,387 --> 00:03:46,686
That night the couple
made sweet, sweet love.

70
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:49,653
Without Early.

71
00:03:49,693 --> 00:03:52,560
Baby doll? Baby doll? You in there?

72
00:03:52,596 --> 00:03:54,996
l got some real special words for you.

73
00:03:55,032 --> 00:03:58,001
Baby doll, will you marry me?

74
00:04:00,204 --> 00:04:01,728
Yeah, l guess.

75
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,966
And bring me that tape player!

76
00:04:04,008 --> 00:04:06,442
- Give it here.
- Now, which end you want me on?

77
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:08,502
You ain't get me no tape cassette?

78
00:04:08,545 --> 00:04:13,983
Oh, flip tapes l know...
Flappin' cake tape capes...tape cassette.

79
00:04:14,018 --> 00:04:16,782
Camper Van Whobilly what?!
Hell, no!

80
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,014
Did you hear me?

81
00:04:18,055 --> 00:04:22,788
<i>l said Bad Company, 10 from 6.
Now move! Let's go, let's go.</i>

82
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:23,952
l'm doing it.

83
00:04:23,994 --> 00:04:26,428
You even believing this mess?

84
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:28,397
What about a damn headache powder?

85
00:04:28,432 --> 00:04:29,592
Do your damn job.

86
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:35,027
Sheriff, hey, it's me, Early.

87
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,173
Early Cuyler
spent the next 15 years in prison.

88
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,907
% Hard times, hard times %

89
00:04:43,947 --> 00:04:46,313
% Lord, how do they hang down %

90
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,148
One and two and three and twirl.
Two and...

91
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:51,746
No, no, no. You twirl on four!

92
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:54,917
- This ain't gon' be worth a damn.
- One and two and three and twirl...

93
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,086
Meanwhile, Early's
dear fiancée waited for him.

94
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:00,995
For 1 2.14 seconds.

95
00:05:01,031 --> 00:05:04,194
Oh my God, it's even got a jog timer!

96
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:07,260
l'm gonna be a jogger.

97
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:11,104
And with this free
one year subscription digital watch...

98
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:17,137
l now pronounce you
man of snakeish descent and...

99
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:18,341
lordy.

100
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:22,216
She was carrying
the fruit of Early's efforts.

101
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,920
- Thank God you're here. Please help!
- Not him.

102
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:27,719
- No, wait, don't leave, no!
- Him.

103
00:05:27,758 --> 00:05:29,453
Please, no!

104
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:33,486
Unbeknownst to Early,
a child was born, a son.

105
00:05:35,132 --> 00:05:38,568
- Good luck with that crap.
- Go, go, go!

106
00:05:38,602 --> 00:05:40,900
The boy was left with Early's sister Lil.

107
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:47,343
She ran a beauty
parlor/boiled peanut-ery off 575.

108
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:51,581
Look at him.

109
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:53,583
Where's my damn chicken?!

110
00:05:55,652 --> 00:05:58,416
% Lil named that boy Rusty %

111
00:05:58,455 --> 00:06:04,485
% And she raised him up
as best she could %

112
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:10,058
Damn, Lil, that boy can perm!

113
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,965
How much do l owe you?

114
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,100
Hey, Lil? Excuse me.

115
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:22,078
Did you know that moonshine
is illegal in this county here?

116
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:24,808
That's just my meth lab.

117
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:27,180
You know what it looks like from here?

118
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:32,519
A mortal eye of God collapsing into itself
with the insatiable color of the soul...

119
00:06:32,556 --> 00:06:34,820
forever warmed in never-ending oneness.

120
00:06:34,858 --> 00:06:37,520
And listen,
that's not to reject the one, 'cause l...

121
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:38,892
l'm saved!

122
00:06:41,498 --> 00:06:43,966
Turns out Rusty
had shampooed the Sheriff...

123
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:47,437
with over half a million dollars
of crystal meth.

124
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:49,098
Smoke his head!

125
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,940
So the state stepped in and placed Rusty
in a more positive environment.

126
00:06:53,977 --> 00:06:57,378
When l was little,
we didn't have fancy ketchup.

127
00:06:57,414 --> 00:06:59,109
We just had ketchup.

128
00:06:59,149 --> 00:07:03,381
We used to make it out
in the back out of opossum tails.

129
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,684
Only we just called it blood.

130
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:08,316
ls that right, now?
Well, granny, l gotta git.

131
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:12,727
l'll have Mongolian beef, side order
of sow chow chicken, spring vegetable...

132
00:07:12,763 --> 00:07:16,529
and l don't want any sesame seeds
in it and the princess rolls.

133
00:07:17,768 --> 00:07:21,033
Yeah, well, that's nice, granny.
l gotta go. l gotta get on out of here.

134
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:23,596
- l'll see you later, OK?
- That's God's truth.

135
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,599
When Jesus was president,
he ate babies all the time.

136
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:29,271
Boy, look at the time!

137
00:07:29,313 --> 00:07:33,909
Wait a minute. Was that Satan?
One of them ate babies.

138
00:07:33,951 --> 00:07:35,350
OK, l gotta go.

139
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:43,985
Well, l just had me a gizgasm.

140
00:07:46,163 --> 00:07:49,462
% Boredom and loneliness,
boredom and loneliness %

141
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:52,559
% Boredom and loneliness,
boredom and loneliness %

142
00:07:52,603 --> 00:07:56,130
% Boredom and loneliness %

143
00:07:56,173 --> 00:08:01,475
% lt's lonely %

144
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:03,342
% When you're with your granny %

145
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:08,309
And that's when a wolf saved his life.

146
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:10,445
And then ate his face.

147
00:08:10,487 --> 00:08:11,715
% lt's a wolf attack %

148
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:14,553
For the next 11 years,
Rusty was raised by wolves.

149
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,422
l'm doing it. Look at me, l'm doing it!

150
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,860
- Horribly.
- No, Daddy, no!

151
00:08:18,895 --> 00:08:21,887
And then the tooth fairy
will come and bring me money?

152
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,600
Where's he do it?
Right here?

153
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:28,503
So, babies don't come out the butt?

154
00:08:34,244 --> 00:08:37,270
But this time it was Rusty
who had the upper hand.

155
00:08:37,314 --> 00:08:40,806
Having filled his body
with 300 pounds of nitroglycerin...

156
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:44,116
Rusty blew all the wolves
and much of the forest...

157
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:46,019
into a fine brown mist.

158
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:51,517
Fortunately for the wolves,
this was but a dream.

159
00:08:52,763 --> 00:08:55,994
All right! l'm in Rush!
Electric jug, baby.

160
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,762
This, too, was a dream.

161
00:08:57,801 --> 00:09:00,929
Oh, God.
l had the weirdest damn dream.

162
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:03,701
l was in that band Rush.
Granny was there.

163
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,140
And l yelled, ''Show me your tatas!''

164
00:09:06,176 --> 00:09:08,906
And she done it.
Oh, God, and l liked it.

165
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:12,574
- You're butt-ass naked.
- No, l ain't. Oh, my God!

166
00:09:12,616 --> 00:09:13,844
Dream.

167
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:16,284
This actually happened.

168
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,345
You so soft.

169
00:09:20,357 --> 00:09:21,449
This looks real.

170
00:09:21,491 --> 00:09:23,755
% Let's just put him here %

171
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:25,125
