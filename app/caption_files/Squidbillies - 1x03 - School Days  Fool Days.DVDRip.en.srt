1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,929
% My dreams are all dead and buried %

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,803
% Sometimes l wish the sun
would just explode %

3
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:20,937
% When God comes
and calls me to His kingdom %

4
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:25,515
% l'll take all you sons of bitches
when l go %

5
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:30,589
- My turn.
- Hell, no.

6
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:33,787
- Man, let me drive that thing. Come on!
- Do not touch the trim!

7
00:00:36,197 --> 00:00:39,166
Nothing binds
a father and a son more closely...

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,433
than the truth behind
the decapitated hooker in the rec room.

9
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:47,999
But peewee sports
are good at that, too.

10
00:00:48,042 --> 00:00:52,035
Now, Russell, l know your nerves
must be a-jingle-jangling about right now.

11
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,104
l just don't want
to let you down, daddy.

12
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:55,911
Son, it ain't about that.

13
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,510
lt's about getting out there
and having some fun!

14
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:02,545
Now, you remember that motivatical cheer
me and you come up with?

15
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:06,390
- Win or you'll whup my ass?
- Correct. Hands in, on three.

16
00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:07,792
One...

17
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:12,563
One?

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,262
- One! Win or l'll whup your ass!
- Win or you'll whup my ass!

19
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:18,066
Wait a minute, boy.
Don't forget your face protectings.

20
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:20,335
l'm sorry, daddy,
l never played soccer before.

21
00:01:20,374 --> 00:01:23,537
And you ain't never going to!
Now, get in there and fight like a cock!

22
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,742
Let the ground spew forth
1,000 geysers of blood...

23
00:01:28,783 --> 00:01:30,011
Where's the ball?

24
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,111
...as these furious, pumped-up cocks
erupt in massive violence.

25
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:38,489
- l don't like soccer, Daddy.
- Place your bets. All windows are open.

26
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:41,017
Only one will survive.

27
00:01:42,463 --> 00:01:44,431
Get a goal for your daddy now.

28
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:49,730
l'm gonna put me down this many
on that there eight-legged chicken to lose.

29
00:01:50,037 --> 00:01:51,732
lt's the 5-0!
Griffin!

30
00:01:52,773 --> 00:01:54,331
To Beldendorf!

31
00:01:55,276 --> 00:01:57,369
Wait a minute.
Where's everybody going?

32
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:59,072
This looks like a good'n.

33
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:03,375
Finish him!

34
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:05,647
- Sheriff?
- Oh, no. Rusty?

35
00:02:05,686 --> 00:02:08,883
- You all right?
- Hell, yeah.

36
00:02:10,591 --> 00:02:11,580
No.

37
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:13,886
Finish him!

38
00:02:15,362 --> 00:02:16,351
Hell.

39
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:22,702
ls that Rusty?
lt's Rusty, ain't it?

40
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:29,437
- Hey, Rusty.
- Hey, Granny.

41
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:32,906
- Hiya, Rusty.
- All right, woman.

42
00:02:34,315 --> 00:02:36,078
Now, get on back to the home
where they want you.

43
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:39,882
- l'm saying hey.
- And say hey to that oxygen tank for me.

44
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:43,421
- You mean Barry?
- Whatever the name is.

45
00:02:43,457 --> 00:02:47,894
Hey, Barry. l ran into Rusty,
and he wanted me to tell...

46
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:49,828
How you doing, Early? Lil?

47
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:53,595
Would y'all care to know
where l found your boy here?

48
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:56,068
- Nope.
- OK.

49
00:02:56,103 --> 00:02:58,537
- How about you, Early?
- Oh, yeah!

50
00:02:58,572 --> 00:03:02,838
How was Disneyland, Rusty?
Hell, that sounds nice.

51
00:03:02,877 --> 00:03:05,641
Did you run about
with that Doofy and Marty Mouse?

52
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:09,581
Yeah, we did all that,
but that's not why l come up here.

53
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:17,619
Why did l come up here?

54
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:20,786
l was having
such a good time in Disneyland.

55
00:03:20,828 --> 00:03:23,319
l rode the hell out of Disneyland.

56
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:28,233
Now they're all looking at me.
Waiting for me.

57
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:31,397
l'll respond to them
in their earth language, l guess.

58
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,503
- Yes.
- OK then.

59
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,135
Get off my land, OK?
Have a good'n.

60
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:38,474
One other thing, Early.

61
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:40,810
- Your boy needs to be in school.
- School?!

62
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:45,376
Ain't that the damn place where they got
all them, let's see, what you call them...

63
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,513
fold-outs, covered in scribblings,
wrote up all over?

64
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:51,524
- Books?
- No, no. Like square, like a magazine.

65
00:03:51,558 --> 00:03:54,618
- Books, Early.
- No, not that, but something like that.

66
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:58,428
- l want to say boo--
- Look, look, look.

67
00:03:58,465 --> 00:04:02,094
All l know is
that if you don't get Rusty in school...

68
00:04:02,136 --> 00:04:06,470
the Board of Education is going
to come up here and kick my ass...

69
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,408
and l'm going to come up here
and kick your ass.

70
00:04:10,444 --> 00:04:12,036
This ass.

71
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:15,081
School days, fool days!

72
00:04:15,115 --> 00:04:17,982
Hell, l couldn't tell you
half the mess l learnt in school.

73
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:22,655
% A, b, c, d, e, f, b %

74
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,286
% C, d, e, f, b %

75
00:04:27,328 --> 00:04:30,923
% E, d, e, f, b %

76
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:34,230
% A, b, c, d, e, f, b %

77
00:04:34,268 --> 00:04:36,600
All right, put them on the hood
and spread them.

78
00:04:36,637 --> 00:04:39,197
Come on, Sheriff.
That's a damn record!

79
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:43,232
l never did find out
what comes after the ''f.''

80
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:46,807
Right. We can't send him down
to the county school...

81
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:51,045
because if we keep segregating there,
it's gonna be nothing but bathrooms, but...

82
00:04:51,085 --> 00:04:52,416
maybe you should consider...

83
00:04:52,453 --> 00:04:56,651
You ain't inseminating l keep him here,
are you? Oh, no. No, no. Hell, no!

84
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,922
- Well, homeschooling is an option.
- What the hell's in it for me?

85
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:01,985
Money.

86
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:05,965
Today, we's learning about rocks.
They's all kinds of rocks.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,699
These is rocks which you throw.
These here is rocks that you get hit by.

88
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:12,831
- Damn, daddy!
- And this here one...

89
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:15,973
is what we call a tooth.

90
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:19,605
Now l'm fixing to take attendance.
Here we go.

91
00:05:27,654 --> 00:05:30,248
Boy, do you want
to pass this class or what?

92
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,656
Yes, l do, daddy.
l would like that very much.

93
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:37,289
All right, then.
When l say Rusty, you say, ''here.''

94
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:40,027
All right? Rusty?

95
00:05:43,437 --> 00:05:47,066
Now on to history.
What just happened?

96
00:05:49,043 --> 00:05:50,408
l don't know.

97
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:54,813
Well, hell, l don't know neither.
Must be a repossessed memory.

98
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:56,713
Damn you, party liquor!

99
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:05,691
Now, Rusty, read me something out loud
from the assigned text.

100
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:06,818
Yes, sir.

101
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,160
''They paint these walls
to hide my pen...

102
00:06:11,198 --> 00:06:13,894
''but this house poet strikes again.''

103
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:16,926
''But this house poet strikes again.''

104
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:22,203
Now what do you think
this house poet meant by that?

105
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:25,575
Well, maybe he feels oppressed
by an Orwellian overlord...

106
00:06:25,612 --> 00:06:29,139
so he lashes out
with guerrilla-style poetry and whatnot.

107
00:06:29,183 --> 00:06:32,152
Yeah, l guess you could
go that way with it.

108
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:34,814
- Continue on with the text.
- Yes, sir.

109
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:40,293
- ''For a good bj, call 555-0169.''
- Wait, hold on now!

110
00:06:41,161 --> 00:06:43,186
Go ahead and repeat
that last stanza again.

111
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,825
- 0169.
- 0169.

112
00:06:47,634 --> 00:06:50,728
Hello?
Are you calling about the bj?

113
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:55,970
- l gives the best bj in town, bar none.
- That be blackberry or blueberry?

114
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:00,878
Boysenberry jam, dumb ass.
Them other ones is out of season.

115
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:03,474
Nope, sorry.
Boysenberries gives me the hives.

116
00:07:03,517 --> 00:07:04,643
All right.

117
00:07:05,552 --> 00:07:10,148
How about l suck your... dry
behind the dumpster at the Sip 'n Strut?

118
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:13,557
Get your stuff, son.
We got us a field trip.

119
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:18,892
Now this here is a field
and you is gonna take a trip.

120
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:22,197
- But that's just a damn well, Daddy.
- Correct.

121
00:07:30,077 --> 00:07:31,544
lf you get out, you pass.

122
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:32,977
Did you throw his ass...

123
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:45,692
- ...down the well? l'm sorry.
- Sure did.

124
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:49,253
Well, l hope he gets out of there
because tonight's the prom.

125
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:52,689
l remember my first prom.

126
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:57,326
Would you like
to dance with me?

127
00:07:57,371 --> 00:08:01,034
l said, do you sumbitches
want to dance?!

128
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:02,701
Take him down!

129
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:07,908
l sure hope l get laid.

130
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:10,382
Me, too, granny.
Me, too.

131
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,886
- Did l pass?
- Pass what?

132
00:08:15,923 --> 00:08:18,585
The field trip!

133
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,425
Nope! Now get your ass washed up, son.
lt's prom night.

134
00:08:27,534 --> 00:08:30,469
Rusty, we've learned a hell of a lot
over this past day...

135
00:08:30,504 --> 00:08:34,099
and you got finals tomorrow,
and after that, the future is limited...

136
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:37,804
only by damn foreigners what come here
and took up all the damn jobs...

137
00:08:37,844 --> 00:08:41,075
and you can't shoot them
because then you're the one at fault!

138
00:08:41,114 --> 00:08:42,342
No offense, Ting Tong.

139
00:08:43,984 --> 00:08:46,214
Hell!
He's interpretating that all wrong.

140
00:08:46,253 --> 00:08:48,721
- Give me them damn flags!
- Excuse me.

141
00:08:48,755 --> 00:08:50,484
l'll show you how to flag dance!

142
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:58,159
You two are just the cutest.

143
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:02,567
You mind if l steal him
for just a little bit of this dance?

144
00:09:02,603 --> 00:09:05,595
l'm afraid
this handsome fella here is taken.

145
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:08,700
l just got sassed by a whore!

146
00:09:08,742 --> 00:09:12,576
- Back off, you old bitch! He is mine!
- Yeah, it's on!

147
00:09:14,548 --> 00:09:17,608
Let's see what kind
of whore moves you got.

148
00:09:17,651 --> 00:09:18,811
Taste the steel!

149
00:09:23,757 --> 00:09:25,281
Oh, yeah.

150
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:30,656
Ting Tong, you want to dance?

151
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:32,722
Prom's over!
Pop quiz!

152
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:36,398
All right, Russell.
How's it going in there, son?

153
00:09:36,436 --> 00:09:39,837
Well, pretty good
exceptin' there ain't no paper.

154
00:09:39,873 --> 00:09:42,535
Now you are square
over the hole, ain't you?

155
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:46,478
Damn!
Can l start this thing over?

156
00:09:46,513 --> 00:09:48,538
Get out here and

157
00:09:50,017 --> 00:09:52,451
- ls this the test?
- Yes, son.

158
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:54,818
Now there's something
you're supposed to do...

159
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,720
when that train gets barreling on you.

160
00:09:56,757 --> 00:10:00,284
You can stay on the tracks,
or you can m--

161
00:10:02,996 --> 00:10:04,156
Malt liquor!

162
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:08,531
- Mufflers!
- Come on, Rusty. You can do it.

163
00:10:08,568 --> 00:10:11,401
Motascribularmultablisade.

164
00:10:11,438 --> 00:10:14,703
- Mecklegriffleso?
- Remember what l learned you, son!

165
00:10:14,741 --> 00:10:17,801
- l ain't no good at tests!
