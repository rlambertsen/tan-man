00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,929
% My dreams are all dead and buried %

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,803
% Sometimes l wish the sun
would just explode %

3
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:20,937
% When God comes
and calls me to His kingdom %

4
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:25,515
% l'll take all you sons of bitches
when l go %

5
00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:32,325
- My turn.
- Come on!

6
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:33,621
Don't touch the trim!

7
00:00:42,136 --> 00:00:44,036
% Talking to your lover %

8
00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:51,104
% Pour me a glass of rum %

9
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:53,477
% Open the door %

10
00:00:55,316 --> 00:00:58,513
% l need a lover %

11
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:00,747
There's nothing more stupid on Earth...

12
00:01:00,788 --> 00:01:05,384
than the love between an uneducated squid
and his illegitimate son.

13
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:10,955
- Do it again, boy!
- l'll do it right again right now.

14
00:01:10,998 --> 00:01:14,729
Right. Look here. Make sure
you checkify and lookifize your blind spot.

15
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:15,758
Yes, sir!

16
00:01:19,774 --> 00:01:22,106
Hell, yeah! Did you like that?
Did l do it, daddy?

17
00:01:22,143 --> 00:01:25,203
l'm so damn proud of you, son.
Hell, do it again. Let's go.

18
00:01:25,246 --> 00:01:27,976
Early, come in here.
l fried up a mess of mud.

19
00:01:28,015 --> 00:01:31,815
Look here. Guess who just learned
hisself some parallel parking?

20
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:37,549
- Rusty?
- What the...?! Me, you dumb bitch.

21
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:39,024
Mud's getting cold.

22
00:01:39,059 --> 00:01:41,960
l don't want no more fried mud.
l want a grape popsicle.

23
00:01:41,996 --> 00:01:44,931
- l don't want no mud...
- Settle down, Rusty.

24
00:01:44,965 --> 00:01:47,365
l told you once,
l don't want no more mud.

25
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:50,029
- Give me something different.
- Rusty!

26
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:52,271
Grape damn popsicle.

27
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:55,639
Lil, looks like we got us
a damn connoisseur over here.

28
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:59,077
- So you want a grape popsicle?
- Yes, sir.

29
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:02,207
How about l shove a pine stick up your ass
and make you a boysicle?

30
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:06,276
- How'd you like that mess?
- No, sir.

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,380
Well, Rusty, you want yourself
some real gourmet food...

32
00:02:09,423 --> 00:02:12,551
then why don't you try
working yourself a real damn job.

33
00:02:12,593 --> 00:02:15,391
Ain't you got a real job, daddy?

34
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:19,622
- What time is it?
- About 2:30.

35
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,163
What the...?! Damn!

36
00:02:22,203 --> 00:02:24,967
l'm two days
and six hours late for work.

37
00:02:25,005 --> 00:02:28,736
% Work, work, work, work %

38
00:02:33,147 --> 00:02:36,207
% Ready, going to work %

39
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,014
% You're late, you're late, you're late %

40
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:45,081
Even an ex-con needs a second chance.

41
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,686
Fortunately for Early,
his boss believed in forgiveness.

42
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:52,165
And this here
is the lmmaculate Conceptor.

43
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,568
lt's got special heavenly coils
that'll make you sleep for three days.

44
00:02:56,604 --> 00:03:01,132
Then you will arise rested and refreshed.
And if you ain't completely satisfied...

45
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:04,633
you will experience the second coming
of your cash or store credit.

46
00:03:04,678 --> 00:03:08,409
- Great. We're just looking, thanks.
- Well, look at this here. Yeah!

47
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:10,679
Look at this.
Egyptian cotton.

48
00:03:10,718 --> 00:03:13,414
l know the slaves made it
but hell, they got away.

49
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:16,514
That's OK. You know,
we're not big, you know, sleepers.

50
00:03:16,557 --> 00:03:18,024
You could be, believe it.

51
00:03:18,058 --> 00:03:22,392
Baptimize yourself in total comfort
as you part the bad seed...

52
00:03:22,429 --> 00:03:25,523
- OK, well, we need to go.
- Come on back here, Jerry. Looky here.

53
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:28,057
- Steve, actually.
- What's this look like?

54
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:31,027
- Water?
- Yes, yes.

55
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:33,733
But it could be wine.
You know, the kind she makes...

56
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:35,639
when the mood is getting just right?

57
00:03:35,676 --> 00:03:37,906
- Yeah, l know...
- What l'm saying, Jerry...

58
00:03:37,945 --> 00:03:41,676
When she gets to saying,
''Ooh, Daddy! Big Daddy Jerry, yeah!''

59
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:44,445
- Well, we got to go.
- Gimme this here!

60
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:47,283
- Now, we gonna give it a test spank.
- You hold on just a minute.

61
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:50,347
You gotta watch, otherwise,
l ain't gonna get off!

62
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:54,088
Before we do this,
l am gonna need a major credit card.

63
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:57,495
Brother Early, a word, please.

64
00:03:57,531 --> 00:03:59,999
Preacher says, ''lt ain't working out.''
So l said...

65
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:03,265
''Read the Bible?
l'll feed you the damn Bible!''

66
00:04:03,304 --> 00:04:07,502
- Hot damn, Daddy, you did that?
- You did not.

67
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,532
Then what happened?

68
00:04:10,577 --> 00:04:14,206
Oh, yeah. That's when l brought him down
with the riot baton.

69
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:17,342
l run for a spell, but...
You caught me, didn't you, old man?

70
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:20,751
Sure did, Early.
Your legs ain't what they used to be.

71
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:23,382
- l can still kick.
- All right, all right.

72
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:25,449
Get the keys, Rusty!
Get the damn keys!

73
00:04:25,492 --> 00:04:28,052
- l'm wild!
- Of course you are.

74
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:32,464
But, Early, you know you're violating
parole if you're not gainfully employed.

75
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:35,832
Take his ass back to jail, Sheriff.
He's too damn dumb to be free.

76
00:04:35,869 --> 00:04:37,928
- Mind your mouth, woman.
- l ain't afraid of you.

77
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:39,997
- You want to die, woman?
- Come on!

78
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,200
Just let me at her.

79
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:45,041
- Come on, Froggy, jump!
- Knock it off, you two.

80
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,138
Law is law...

81
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:48,910
All right, l've seen enough.

82
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:54,043
- Come on, let's go back into town.
- Daddy, you ain't going back to prison?

83
00:04:54,088 --> 00:04:58,388
At that moment, Early realized
it was too late to get an abortion.

84
00:04:58,425 --> 00:05:02,521
Well, hell, l reckon not, Rusty.

85
00:05:02,563 --> 00:05:05,327
Fetch me my formal attire.

86
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:09,598
The time has come
to matriculate myself unto a real job.

87
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:15,304
- ''Where do l see myself in five beers?''
- Years. Years.

88
00:05:15,342 --> 00:05:17,537
l don't know. Jail?

89
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:20,172
- Well...
- Don't say jail.

90
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:21,806
Prison.

91
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:25,148
Well, hell, how hard could it be?
lt ain't brain surgery.

92
00:05:25,185 --> 00:05:29,519
- lt is brain surgery.
- l got a knife. Where's the brain at?

93
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:31,148
Early!

94
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:34,752
- How hard could this be? lt ain't rocket...
- Let's just go.

95
00:05:34,795 --> 00:05:37,992
Early. Hey, Early. Stop it!

96
00:05:38,032 --> 00:05:40,660
That there's my first impression,
right there!

97
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:43,568
Early, meeting.

98
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:48,970
- Meeting?
- Oh, well. Damn, l'm sorry.

99
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:52,706
Good morning. My name's Early,
and l'm a real book nut.

100
00:05:52,746 --> 00:05:56,182
As you can tell by your face there,
l'm very highly motivated.

101
00:05:56,216 --> 00:05:58,878
- l got boundless energy...
- Yeah, maybe we should go.

102
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,615
When can l expect to hear something?

103
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:03,088
Hello?

104
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:06,217
So l debarked
from my previous emploratorium...

105
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:12,062
to encrotch upon more moneyfied
situlations like this here opportronity.

106
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:14,033
- l seen your sign...
- Brother Early!

107
00:06:14,068 --> 00:06:16,798
l fired you!

108
00:06:17,671 --> 00:06:19,229
Just yesterday.

109
00:06:20,274 --> 00:06:22,765
Wonderful.
So you have an opening, then.

110
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:28,373
l have a restraining order.
May God have mercy on your soul.

111
00:06:28,415 --> 00:06:30,906
Who's the sumbitch told you that?

112
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:32,782
Where do you keep getting these things?

113
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,516
Mind your business.
This here's a tense negotionation.

114
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:41,216
l do apprecianate the generous offer,
but knifery is the tool of a idiot.

115
00:06:41,261 --> 00:06:44,697
l listen to my gut,
and my gut tells me that this ain't a fit...

116
00:06:44,731 --> 00:06:48,258
but my heart says
this could work and gut's a damn moron.

117
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:51,601
So they get to carrying on,
and then my brain chimes in...

118
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:56,268
and sayin' l got to try my hand at
the fast sex-paced world of adult literature.

119
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,542
This here's a four-figure opportunity.
You sure you don't want to sleep on it?

120
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:03,641
You want to sleep forever?
l said adult literature.

121
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,757
Read this erotic sumbitch here.
Read it slow.

122
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:25,438
l believe that's an ampersand.

123
00:07:28,008 --> 00:07:29,566
Does that get you hot?

124
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,013
- You know, l prefer mysteries.
- Damn computers!

125
00:07:34,748 --> 00:07:37,239
''Just stay perfectly still.''

126
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:41,015
What the hell kind of job is that?

127
00:07:41,955 --> 00:07:43,081
Let's talk benefits.

128
00:07:44,892 --> 00:07:48,794
Look at my damn mouth.
Hell, l ain't paying for dental.

129
00:07:49,796 --> 00:07:52,162
So, under experience...

130
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,726
you've listed here,
on your hat-shaped resume...

131
00:07:55,769 --> 00:08:01,002
that you can skin a buck, run a trout line,
and that all your rowdy friends...

132
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:03,710
Are coming over tonight. Yes, sir.

133
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:07,510
Early, you're the most impressive squid
l've interviewed for this position.

134
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:10,517
Let's talk briefly about your work ethic.

135
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:14,419
Well, l don't think ethnics do no work.
l mean, that's they problem, really.

136
00:08:14,454 --> 00:08:16,752
lf you ain't like me,
go hang from a damn tree.

137
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,190
Overt racial prejudice.

138
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:20,921
lmpressive, Early.

139
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:22,622
- l thank you kindly.
- Certainly.

140
00:08:22,663 --> 00:08:26,064
And your reference checks out.

141
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:28,067
Hello, over there.

142
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:33,038
l think what most impresses me,
Early, is the effort in detail...

143
00:08:33,073 --> 00:08:36,873
which you've clearly shown
in urinating on my laptop.

144
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,606
l don't care to consort
with those of the robot race.

145
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:42,843
And why would you?
l think that covers it.

146
00:08:42,883 --> 00:08:46,580
Early, welcome
to Dan Halen Sheetrock lnternational.

147
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,454
- Congratulations.
- What l gotta do?

148
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,390
Well, you're my boss...

149
00:08:52,426 --> 00:08:57,830
and as CEO you'll have
certain responsibilities, like showing up...

150
00:08:57,864 --> 00:08:59,855
and leaving...

151
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:04,599
and accepting liability
for certain class-action lawsuits...

152
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:08,836
that may or may not,
and in fact currently are being levied...

153
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,843
against new products such as...

154
00:09:10,877 --> 00:09:12,902
The pocket surgeon!

155
00:09:12,946 --> 00:09:15,915
Just scrape the rust
from the collapsible tumor scoop and...

156
00:09:15,949 --> 00:09:18,679
Look, you won't have
to know any of this stuff.

157
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:21,847
- The point is, people are dumb.
- ls my mind going on me...

158
00:09:21,888 --> 00:09:25,153
or am l watching you jibber jabber
like some sort of jibberty box?

159
00:09:25,192 --> 00:09:27,854
- Jibber jabber on, jibber jabber on.
- l'm sorry.

160
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:32,160
l'm just a brash intern.
lt won't happen again, sir.

161
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,233
Well, damn, now l feel bad.

162
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:38,465
Tell you what, take the day off.

163
00:09:38,505 --> 00:09:40,336
Working with me, fire and ice.

164
00:09:40,374 --> 00:09:42,706
