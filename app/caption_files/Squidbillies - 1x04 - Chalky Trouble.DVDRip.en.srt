00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,929
% My dreams are all dead and buried %

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:15,803
% Sometimes l wish the sun
would just explode %

3
00:00:16,944 --> 00:00:20,937
% When God comes
and calls me to His kingdom %

4
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:25,480
% l'll take all you sons of bitches
when l go %

5
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:30,589
- My turn.
- Hell, no.

6
00:00:30,624 --> 00:00:33,787
- Man, let me drive that thing. Come on!
- Do not touch the trim!

7
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:54,806
Naw, l don't need no lnternet.

8
00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:58,751
No, sir. Not in my life.

9
00:00:58,786 --> 00:01:03,621
- What's that, daddy?
- Rusty, what do you think of white people?

10
00:01:03,657 --> 00:01:06,922
Well, l... l reckon they OK.
l likey my Doobie Brothers.

11
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,993
- He ain't ready.
- That's not rightly fairly.

12
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:16,127
We all was loving Doobie Brothers.

13
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,570
Yeah, hell,
l reckon you right.

14
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:21,507
Damn them Doobies
and they Chinese Grove.

15
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:24,978
Russell, are you ready
for the special night tonight?

16
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:26,070
What we gonna do?

17
00:01:26,113 --> 00:01:29,549
Go down to Atlanta and whip our shirts off,
start a bunch of bullness?

18
00:01:29,583 --> 00:01:32,882
Nope. Funner than that.

19
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:54,972
You heard what she said. Now, go ahead
and put your arm up right here.

20
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,809
- Why do l gotta do that for, Daddy?
- Witches be gone from his body!

21
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:01,908
My will hath been done.

22
00:02:01,949 --> 00:02:04,577
We ain't driving
no witches from his body.

23
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:06,586
Well, it's done.

24
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,488
Tonight's good old
Tuesday's Hate White Rally.

25
00:02:10,524 --> 00:02:12,116
Look at my hand, Daddy.

26
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:13,888
- Yeah, l see that.
- lt hurts.

27
00:02:13,928 --> 00:02:17,694
Well, y'all need me, l'll be putting
pictures of my ass on the lnternet.

28
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:20,495
Lil, you ain't gonna come out
and hate the whites with us?

29
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:22,161
We gonna roast some weenies.

30
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,034
Well, la dee damn da.

31
00:02:25,773 --> 00:02:27,434
All right, then, where was we at?

32
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:36,246
Give us the strength
to cleanse the Earth...

33
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:41,585
of the milk chalk scourge
so they keep 'em away from me.

34
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:44,216
Dump 'em on the island!
Blow up the island.

35
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,460
Look ye upon this cash money
a symbol of the white power...

36
00:02:50,497 --> 00:02:54,957
who would jingle the smartest fool
with metally money.

37
00:02:55,002 --> 00:02:57,971
- Burn all the metally money!
- Burn it now!

38
00:03:02,543 --> 00:03:05,444
- All right, now, Granny. Burn your money.
- No, thank you.

39
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:10,917
And these skis,
tools of their wicked recreational activities.

40
00:03:10,951 --> 00:03:13,886
Chalk men skiing on his white
snow in his tighty whites...

41
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:17,413
just like a white wing dove
sing a song about what they singing.

42
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:21,861
- Hoo, baby, hoo, baby, hoo!
- Light the damn skis.

43
00:03:21,896 --> 00:03:25,730
That a boy, Rusty! Burn them
son-a-bitches. Embrace the hatred.

44
00:03:25,766 --> 00:03:27,893
They live in houses,
don't they, Daddy?

45
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:31,471
Burn the damn house!

46
00:03:35,776 --> 00:03:38,176
Guess white people
do live in houses.

47
00:03:38,212 --> 00:03:40,476
Hot damn, what about
these trees over here?

48
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:45,847
- What about these trees, Granny?
- No, the trees are fine.

49
00:03:48,756 --> 00:03:50,849
- Burn the damn trees.
- Burn them!

50
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:55,626
Look, everyone!

51
00:03:57,164 --> 00:03:59,564
lt's the creature from the prophecy.

52
00:04:01,335 --> 00:04:03,030
Naw, it's just me.

53
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:06,733
Help me, Obi Wan,
you're my only hope.

54
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:09,936
For luck. Get it?

55
00:04:09,977 --> 00:04:11,535
<i>Star Wars?</i>

56
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:16,883
Ain't this the sci-fi convention?

57
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:20,148
Enter the circle of fire
and answer the inquisitation.

58
00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:22,883
Answer the inquisitation.

59
00:04:25,426 --> 00:04:28,520
Stop those drums, Kevin!

60
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:35,331
Tell me, Sheriff. What do you...
What do you think of white people?

61
00:04:35,369 --> 00:04:40,329
Well, they're all right, l guess.
l mean, l like them Doobie Brothers.

62
00:04:40,374 --> 00:04:43,400
Doobies aside.
Doobies has been desquawkified. All right?

63
00:04:43,444 --> 00:04:46,379
Actually, Early,
l really don't mind whites so much.

64
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:49,712
l mean, some of my best friends are white.
Like me. l'm white.

65
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,880
- You what to the what now?
- Did l mention that to you boys?

66
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:56,719
Hey, look. See?

67
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:59,920
White as a Vidalia onion
and twice as sweet.

68
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,418
- Oh, no.
- Denial! Denial!

69
00:05:03,464 --> 00:05:08,026
l have done deceptified
by a Sheriff with ognorance.

70
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:09,501
Burn the Sheriff.

71
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:15,701
ls that what this is all about?
A Hate White rally?

72
00:05:15,743 --> 00:05:17,870
Well, it don't have to be just whites.

73
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:21,142
l mean, we're all inclusive here,
except for them damn whites.

74
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:23,308
Why do you squids
hate whites so bad?

75
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,184
Typical. Whitey needs
an explanation for every damn thing.

76
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:32,124
- Hey, Sheriff, where's your skis?
- Yeah, Chalky loves to ski, don't he?

77
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,627
Early, we're all the same
on the inside.

78
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:36,094
Here, take a look.

79
00:05:37,431 --> 00:05:41,595
Up my butt.
l've had some pain recently.

80
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:44,763
- You see anything?
- A lot of red.

81
00:05:47,074 --> 00:05:49,099
What happened
to the damn house?!

82
00:05:49,143 --> 00:05:51,976
That there's a symbol
of the evil white chalky man, Daddy.

83
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:55,709
- lt's a symbol of where l keep my ... son!
- l'll tell you something...

84
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:59,879
and l'll say it right now with my mouth
and it needs to be listen-ded.

85
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,252
Whites is too deflective...

86
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:06,282
with their sheeny skin
beating sunlight into my eyes.

87
00:06:06,326 --> 00:06:09,261
Can't tell them apart,
looking like lightbulbs with shoes on...

88
00:06:09,296 --> 00:06:11,230
all be-bopping around all over the place.

89
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:13,130
Except for you, Sheriff.

90
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:14,293
You one of the good ones.

91
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:16,894
- Oh, yeah. You one of the good ones.
- Thank you, ma'am.

92
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:18,199
'Cause you got a gun.

93
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:20,672
Now, Sheriff,
unless you come up here to sexotize...

94
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:22,197
humpify or bangulate my grandma...

95
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:24,836
then l suggest you turn
your pretty little whitey wagon around...

96
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:27,005
and get on back to chalky town.

97
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:29,641
l will, Early.
But before l go...

98
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:34,245
l'm going to tell you where society
would be without the white man.

99
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:41,390
Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton gin.
A white man.

100
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:43,225
How about Crawford Long?

101
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:47,199
He discovered ether,
when he wasn't busy being white.

102
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:50,726
And you know that Sphinx in
the ancient pyramids of Egypt?

103
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:54,366
- Who do you think built those, Rusty?
- l don't know. Chalkasians?

104
00:06:54,408 --> 00:06:57,536
Actually, no.
But they were in charge, probably.

105
00:06:57,578 --> 00:07:01,309
Any fans of basketball out there?
Here's a name.

106
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:06,308
Larry Bird.
The inventor of the slam dunk.

107
00:07:06,353 --> 00:07:10,449
That's a signature white move.
Look it up.

108
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:12,823
Rusty, you know the rap music?

109
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,918
<i>l know N.W.A.</i>

110
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:16,293
% The police going straight
from the underground %

111
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:18,457
% l don't like a brother
'cause he's brown %

112
00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:21,400
Well, those ''N''s wouldn't
have any ''A'' at all...

113
00:07:21,435 --> 00:07:24,302
if it wasn't for the white police state.

114
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:30,299
ln fact, all music:
rock, R&B, gospel, even reggae...

115
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:34,610
descended from,
you guessed it, whites.

116
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:38,448
So, now what do you think?
How you like me now?

117
00:07:38,485 --> 00:07:39,577
What about slavery?

118
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,884
Who abolished it?
A white man, thank you.

119
00:07:41,922 --> 00:07:43,583
But didn't you whip 'em and stuff?

120
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:47,424
Rusty, if it weren't for us whites,
your land right over here...

121
00:07:47,461 --> 00:07:51,295
would be completely
overrun by red lndians.

122
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:54,266
Hell, no.
Not this land, red man!

123
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:05,468
And your Granny over there?
She'd be plunking her life savings...

124
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:09,039
into $5 slots
at a Cherokee Casino and Spa...

125
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:13,143
<i>watching Jay Leno perform
for two weeks this October...</i>

126
00:08:13,187 --> 00:08:17,521
<i>followed
by the Beach Boys featuring Mike Love.</i>

127
00:08:17,558 --> 00:08:19,992
Silence the lies!

128
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:24,428
Why do things have to change?

129
00:08:24,464 --> 00:08:28,161
We've been hating whites
since Jesus was a june bug.

130
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:31,330
Granny, even he was a white man.

131
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:35,307
Here, take a look
at this novelty plastic Jesus.

132
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:38,573
Go ahead.
Pull his sandals.

133
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:39,601
Gotcha!

134
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:46,410
- Now get on back to your teepees!
- Folks, my point is this.

135
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:51,413
- Whites.
- Oh, Jesus. You're white? ls this true?

136
00:08:53,193 --> 00:08:58,426
Yes, child. lt is l, Jesus.
And you know what?

137
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:02,265
Whether you are white, black,
Asian, or Hispanic...

138
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:04,293
we are all the same in spirit.

139
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:07,205
Except for me. l'm pretty amazing.

140
00:09:07,241 --> 00:09:11,871
- Check it out. Was this your card?
- No, Lord.

141
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:16,678
- How about this one?
- Nope.

142
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:18,344
- Then it must be this one.
- Naw.

143
00:09:18,385 --> 00:09:21,912
- OK, can l do it from the top?
- Have you ever done this trick before?

144
00:09:21,955 --> 00:09:25,516
They're stuck is what it is,
and it's hard to... Was this your card?

145
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:30,189
- No.
- Gonna try it one more time, child of mine.

146
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,528
- Was this your card?
- No.

147
00:09:32,566 --> 00:09:34,534
- Was it... Was it diamonds?
- No.

148
00:09:34,568 --> 00:09:36,832
lt wouldn't be a trick
if l told you that.

149
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,201
- Three of hearts.
- No.

150
00:09:38,238 --> 00:09:43,266
No. Oh, Lord, no.
No, that ain't it, either.

151
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,839
No, Lord. Now, see, that's the joker.
That shouldn't even be in the deck.

152
00:09:48,882 --> 00:09:53,819
lt's the five of diamonds, Jesus.
lt's always the damn five of diamonds.

153
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:57,517
There we go!
Hurray, magic Jesus!

154
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:59,889
Did he say anything
different this time?

155
00:09:59,926 --> 00:10:02,394
He says we all gotta love our brother.

156
00:10:02,429 --> 00:10:05,728
ln other words, no.
Thank you, white Jesus!

157
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:08,200
Early, ain't no whites
ever bothered you.

158
00:10:08,235 --> 00:10:11,693
l guess you're just hating
for the sake of hating.

159
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:15,230
lt ain't that, Sheriff.
lt's something else.

160
00:10:16,943 --> 00:10:19,343
She was my dream, my muse...

161
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:22,815
a vision suitable
for the wide screen format.

162
00:10:22,849 --> 00:10:27,582
l can still taste
her fist against my face.

163
00:10:27,621 --> 00:10:32,684
The sweet sugary sweat
from a lifetime of diabetes.

164
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:37,288
A heartbeat you could hear
from six blocks away...
